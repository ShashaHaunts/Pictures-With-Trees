# Project-Assignment-3
This was a given project assignment in my Basic Algorithms & Data Structures course (CPSC 221) in which we were given the task to manipulate images with trees. Some methods were given, however, the majority of it was not. Specifically, we were tasked in making:
* PTree(PNG& imIn)
* PTree(const PTree& other)
* PTree& operator=(const PTree& other)
* ~PTree()
* *void Clear()
* void Copy(const PTree& other)
* PNG Render() const
* int Size() const
* int NumLeaves() const
* Node* BuildNode(PNG& im, pair<unsigned int, unsigned int> ul, unsigned int w, unsigned int h)
* void FlipHorizontal()
* void FlipVertical()
* void Prune(double tolerance)

This project was completed by myself and another student, Gurjot.
